# GoGoGranny

This code was created primarily by myself in the Carnegie Mellon National High School Game Academy. This project was created in Unity in less than two weeks. 

This project is a 3D racing game where grannies race around a bingo hall for the ultimate prize, a coupon book. Items can be picked up from the track and hurled at other grannies. Each item incites a different negative effect on the hit granny.
